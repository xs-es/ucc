Unitary Compiler Collection User Guide
######################################

The Unitary Compiler Collection (UCC) is a Python library for frontend-agnostic, high performance compilation\* of quantum circuits.
It can be used with multiple quantum computing frameworks, including `Qiskit <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit>`_, `Cirq <https://github.com/quantumlib/Cirq>`_, and `PyTKET <https://github.com/CQCL/tket>`_ via OpenQASM2.

Installation
*************

To install ``ucc`` run

.. code:: bash

   pip install ucc

UCC requires Python version ≥ 3.12.

Basic usage
***********

To use UCC, one must first specify a circuit in a supported format.
For basic usage, the circuit of interest is simply input into the function ``ucc.compile()``.
The output of ``ucc.compile()`` is a transpiled circuit that is logically equivalent to the input circuit but with reduced gate counts (and by default returned in the same format) as the input circuit.
For example, we can define a random circuit in Qiskit and optimize it using the default settings of ``ucc.compile()``, as shown in the following example.

..
   This comment is around the testcode/testoutput block below. These leverage
   doctest extension of sphinx to test this code actually runs and any output
   matches. The ELLIPSIS directive (and the use of ... in the expected output) of
   the testoutput block avoids us needing to explicitly have the gate count, which
   is liable to change as ucc changes over time

.. testcode::

   from qiskit.circuit.random import random_clifford_circuit
   import ucc
   from benchmarks.scripts.common import count_multi_qubit_gates_qiskit


   gates = ["cx", "cz", "cy", "swap", "x", "y", "z", "s", "sdg", "h"]
   num_qubits = 10
   raw_circuit = random_clifford_circuit(
      num_qubits, gates=gates, num_gates=10 * num_qubits * num_qubits
   )
   compiled_circuit = ucc.compile(raw_circuit)
   print(
      f"Number of multi-qubit gates in original circuit: {count_multi_qubit_gates_qiskit(raw_circuit)}"
   )
   print(
      f"Number of multi-qubit gates in compiled circuit: {count_multi_qubit_gates_qiskit(compiled_circuit)}"
   )


.. testoutput::
   :hide:
   :options: +ELLIPSIS, +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

   Number of multi-qubit gates in original circuit: ...
   Number of multi-qubit gates in compiled circuit: ...


Default Compilation Passes
**************************

When compiling, UCC uses a set of pre-defined qiskit passes set of compilation passes specified in ``ucc.transpilers.ucc_defaults.UCCDefault1``.
These were chosen based on their good default performance on a set of input circuits. The vision for UCC is
to iterate and improve on these defaults, following the process in :doc:`contributing`.

Customization
*************

UCC offers different levels of customization, from settings accepted by the "default" pass ``UCCDefault1`` to the ability to add custom transpiler passes.

Transpilation settings
======================
UCC settings can be adjusted using the keyword arguments of the ``ucc.compile()`` function, as shown.

.. code:: python

   ucc.compile(
       circuit,
       return_format="original",
       target_device=None,
       custom_passes=None
   )


- ``return_format`` is the format in which the input circuit will be returned, e.g. "TKET" or "OpenQASM2". Check ``ucc.supported_circuit_formats()`` for supported circuit formats. Default is the format of input circuit.
- ``target_device`` can be specified as a Qiskit backend or coupling map, or a list of connections between qubits. If None, all-to-all connectivity is assumed. If a Qiskit backend or coupling map is specified, only the coupling list extracted from the backend is used.
- ``custom_passes`` can be a list of Qiskit ``TransformationPass`` to run after the default set of passes in ``UCCDefault1``.

Writing a custom pass
=====================
UCC reuses part of the Qiskit transpiler framework for creation of custom transpiler passes, specifically the ``TransformationPass`` type of pass and the ``PassManager`` object for running custom passes and sequences of passes.
In the following example, we demonstrate how to create a custom pass, where the Directed Acycylic Graph (DAG) representation of the circuit is the object manipulated by the pass.

..
   This testsetup is associated with subsequent blocks that also have the custom_pass group.
   This setup is run, followed by all the blocks with this group in order and
   ensures the "circuit_to_compile" variable is defined.

.. testsetup:: custom_pass

   from qiskit import QuantumCircuit as QiskitCircuit
   circuit_to_compile = QiskitCircuit(2)
   circuit_to_compile.h(0)
   circuit_to_compile.cx(0, 1)

.. testcode:: custom_pass

   from qiskit.transpiler.basepasses import TransformationPass
   from qiskit.dagcircuit import DAGCircuit

   class MyCustomPass(TransformationPass):

       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__()


       def run(self, dag: DAGCircuit) -> DAGCircuit:
           #  Your code here
           return dag


Applying a non-default pass in the transpilation sequence
=========================================================

The ``compile`` method accepts an optional list of custom passes to run after the default suite defined in the  built-in pass manager ``UCCDefault1().pass_manager``.
In the following example we show how to add pre-defined Qiskit passes for merging single qubit rotations interrupted by a commuting 2 qubit gate.

.. testcode:: custom_pass

   from qiskit.circuit.equivalence_library import SessionEquivalenceLibrary as sel
   from qiskit.transpiler.passes import (
      BasisTranslator,
      Optimize1qGatesSimpleCommutation,
   )
   from ucc import compile


   single_q_basis = ["rz", "rx", "ry", "h"]
   target_basis = single_q_basis.append("cx")

   custom_passes = [
      Optimize1qGatesSimpleCommutation(basis=single_q_basis),
      BasisTranslator(sel, target_basis=target_basis),
   ]

   custom_compiled_circuit = compile(
      circuit_to_compile, custom_passes=custom_passes
   )

Alternatively, we can add our custom pass, as shown in the following example.

.. testcode:: custom_pass

   from ucc import compile
   custom_compiled_circuit = compile(
      circuit_to_compile, custom_passes=[MyCustomPass()]
   )


A note on terminology
*********************

.. important::
   There is some disagreement in the quantum computing community on the proper usage of the terms "transpilation" and "compilation."
   For instance, Qiskit refers to optimization of the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of a circuit as "transpilation," whereas in qBraid, the 1:1 translation of one circuit representation into another without optimization (e.g. a Cirq circuit to a Qiskit circuit; OpenQASM 2 into PyTKET) is called "transpilation."
   In addition, Cirq uses the term "transformer" and PyTKET uses :code:`CompilationUnit` to refer to what Qiskit calls a transpiler pass.
