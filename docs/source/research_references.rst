- :cite:t:`Du:2025dld` introduce CCMap, a modular circuit compiler designed for chip-to-chip coupler-connected quantum systems.
  CCMap improves the fidelity of circuits compiled by reducing costly inter-chip operations and applying noise-aware mapping.
  The authors benchmark their framework by integrating it with several existing compilers,including UCC, and demonstrate that CCMap enhances UCC's performance.
  UCC-CCMap achieved up to **17.8% higher fidelity** and **significant reductions in compilation cost** compared to UCC alone.
